# Kubernetes modules - Contributor guidance

## Code Review Rules

- Review the PR diff for actionable correctness, security, data-loss, and deployment regressions; cite the changed file/line and concrete impact.
- Preserve authentication boundaries, persisted data compatibility, and the project's documented build/test/deploy contracts. Adapt shared patterns to this project's stack.
- Report missing behavioral coverage where it would catch a specific regression; leave formatting and mechanical checks to CI.

## Codex automation

Use native Codex GitHub reviews and `@codex` PR tasks with ChatGPT sign-in.
Setup: https://github.com/mucsi96/skeleton-app/blob/main/docs/codex-automation.md

## Module compatibility

Read the affected module's variables, outputs, and callers before changing its
contract. Check resource replacement, state migrations, secret handling, and
namespace-scoped permissions. Validate changes without applying infrastructure.
